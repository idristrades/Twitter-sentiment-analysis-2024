# Twitter-sentiment-analysis-2024

- This project is to help get unlimited tweets using Nitter (ntscraper) and perform sentiment analysis using textblob at the same time.
- In this example, we'll get the chance to analyse the latest 100 tweets from @elonmusk.
- This can be used to analyse stock related news using the proper keywords.
- First run: pip install ntscraper textblob
